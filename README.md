# OctoPlus
A GUI for Bulk Tasks in Octopus Deploy

Ideas include:
 - Add/Remove role to multiple targets
 - Enable/Disable multiple targets
 - Add/Remove multiple Targets to an Environment

The GUI should be like the existing Deployment Targets page and allow filtering. Once filtered it should give options on the various actions above.

The main frustration with Octopus is that with many targets, adding a role to multiple machines takes lots of clicks and saves. It's very annoying.

Other ideas include things like adding and linking a tenant for a deployment target automatically.
